# vim-textobj-brace

`vim-textobj-brace` is a quick shortcut for having to reach for the specific
text objects for `[]`, `{}`, or `()`.

The `ij` and `aj` text objects will select the innermost of either of the three
brace or bracket characters.


Requires [vim-textobj-user](https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user).
